# BLE Heart Rate Measurement example

This example creates GATT server demonstrating standard Heart Rate measurement service. It sends Heart rate readings measured on the MAX30102 Sensor and notifies to client when the notifications are enabled.

It uses ESP32's Bluetooth controller and NimBLE stack based BLE host

This example aims at understanding notification subscriptions and sending notifications.

To test this demo, I used the LightBlue BLE scanner app.
